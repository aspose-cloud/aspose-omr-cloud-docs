Aspose.OMR Cloud is a REST API to recognize optical mark from OMR scanned sheet images in the cloud. It can be used to recognize optical mark in a variety of image formats like JPG, TIF, TIFF, GIF and PDF documents. The API allows capturing human-marked data from document forms such as surveys, questionnaires, multiple-choice examination paper and other tests. With this Cloud solution, it is possible to recognize scanned images and even photos with high accuracy. Recognition is based on a template markup which contains a graphical mapping of the elements to be recognized from the scanned images.
